            Performance Update!<br>
            With help from Hordex from Discord, we've rewritten most of the explicit update calls to be deferred to the update handler.<br>
            This means that most UI refreshes are now correctly controlled by the "Updates Per Second" setting in the options menu.<br>
            High level players who are still experiencing lag can significantly improve performance by reducing this number - this will only decrease how often the screen refreshes, not how often the game updates.<br>
            ---<br>
            Additionally, we have a number of new global stories for all the zones, action segments, and other updates from MrPitt!

            <b> July 25th, 2022</b>
            • A new guild has opened in Commerceville - Assassins Guild! Kill targets across the world, collect their hearts (why is it always hearts?), and return them to the guild to learn the ways of the assassin<br>
            • New Actions: Assassinate: Assassination targets are now available in every zone. Every assassination carries a very heavy reputation penalty (mitigated by assassin skill) and gets harder based on your reputation and number of assassinations completed this loop<br>
            • New Skill: Assassin - Improves assassination actions and reduces the difficultly scaling in trials<br>
            • New Menu: Totals - Records play metrics including total time played and loops/actions completed<br>
            • Balance: Thieves guild actions gold rewards x2<br>
            • New Option: Highlight New Actions - Places a border around actions that have not yet been completed on this save. Defaults to on, but can be toggled off in options<br>
            • Added max button to Gather Team<br>
            • Typo fixes

            <b> July 20th, 2022</b>
            • Survey Update! Survey is now completed using maps purchased in Beginnersville. Completed maps can be returned to the explorer's guild for extra progress in a random uncompleted area.<br>
            • A few minor bugfixes
            ]]></version>
            <version verNum="2.6"><![CDATA[

            <version verNum="2.5"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 19th, 2022</b>
            • New Option: Stat Colors - Changes stat menu bars to be the same colors used in multipart action bars<br>
            • Removed Simple Tooltips Option - It was extra work to maintain on every update / change<br>
            • Bugfix: DR was not properly increasing zombie strength<br>
            • Balance: Added great feast's bonus to team members and zombies to bring team combat better in line with self combat (this seemed more interesting than just adding a flat x5, but may be changed later)

            <version verNum="2.4"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 20th, 2022</b>
            • Balance: Team combat buffs! Restoration now contributes 4x its level instead of 2x to team member strength<br>
            We'll see how this feels, and can revisit and improve leadership, too, if needed<br>
            • New Option: Players can now enable a setting to have the game automatically pause when a progress action reaches 100% so they can accrue bonus seconds rather than waste time on a loop making little progress<br>
            • Tooltip Updates: Many thanks to MakroCZ from the discord for tireless work on a fix for tooltip placement<br>
            • Tooltip Updates: Kallious from the discord has helped clarify a number of unlock conditions and tided up the tidy up action in Valhalla<br>
            • Bugfix: Imbue Soul could be started at max buff rank, reseting all progress for no reward<br>

            <version verNum="2.3"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 19th, 2022</b>
            • Bugfix: With thanks to Kallious from the Discord, we've finally fixed the bug sometimes making soulstones go negative on DR/IM/GF<br>
            • Bugfix: Added additonal error checks to loading save files to autofix some of the common error states<br>
            • Bugfix: Trial of dead was not using updated zombie strength formula<br>
            • Bugfix: Imbue Soul was not updating training tooltips until next restart

            <version verNum="2.2"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 19th, 2022</b>
            • New Skill: Leadership - Increases your max follower count by 1 for every 100 levels and increases their contribution to team combat<br>
            • New Action (Commerceville): Motivational Seminar - Get advice from the head of a totally-not-an-MLM to learn how to be a better leader<br>
            • Balance: Zombie Strength is now increased by Dark Ritual / 100(min 1x, up to 6.66x increase)<br>
            • Balance: Fight Jungle Monsters now rewards blood instead of hides. Prepare Buffet is now made of blood instead of hide. Still gross.<br>
            Note - We'll have to see how these changes land. It may end up being that now Team Combat is too strong compared to self combat. Also, trials will almost certainly need rebalancing.<br>
            • Bugfix: Fight actions were giving exp on segment in addition to completion. Increased combat exp of frost/giants & jungle monsters to compensate<br>
            • Bugfix: Explorer's guild was not reducing the cost of excursion<br>
            ]]></version>

            • Balance: Reducted Alchemy Skill requirement of Looping potion from 500 to 200<br>
            • Balance: Jungle Escape now only needs to be started within 60s, not completed within 60s<br>
            • Bugfix: Excursion was requiring the player to have more gold than the cost rather than more or equal<br>
            • Bugfix: Troll's blood still said it did nothing<br>
            • Bugfix: Reduce the amount of time "Saved" appear on loadouts from 2s -> 1s<br>
            • Bugfix: Secret trial couldn't be started<br>
            • Bugfix: Soulstone display wasn't being updated after imbue soul<br>
            • Change: The game will now persist any current options set when starting a new game or beginning a challenge<br>

            <version verNum="2.0"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 16th, 2022</b>
            Added Challenge Modes!<br>
            Challenges are super hard modifications to the base game with extra restrictions in place.<br>
            These are only for fun and do not give any rewards.<br>
            ]]></version>
            <version verNum="1.9"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 16th, 2022</b>
            • Change: Added "Max Training" button to bottom of action list that will cap all training actions present on the list. This button only appears after players have completed their first imbue mind to reduce clutter<br>

            • Bugfix: StonesUsed from Haul was not properly resetting on clearing saves<br>
            • Bugfix: Off-by-One error in final trial was preventing players from being able to finish<br>
            • Bugfix: Trial tooltips were displaying incorrect floor numbers<br>
            • Bugfix: Trolls, Frost Giants, and Jungle Monsters were giving combat exp per action rather than per kill. These actions will likely need significant combat skill exp buffs after to compensate for this fix

            <version verNum="1.8"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 14th, 2022</b>
            • New Trial: Trial of the Dead (Startington) - Basely soley off your Zombie contributions to team combat, completing floors rewards even more zombies<br>
            • Bugfix: Swapped the Clear List and Manage Loadout buttons so the loadout popup would be less likely to get in the way when editing action amounts<br>
            • Bugfix: Added survey icon to new actions added by survey so they are easier to notice<br>
            • Bugfix: Haul wasn't being properly capped per zone, allowing stones to become negative

            <b> July 14th, 2022</b>
            Endgame content complete!<br>
            The endgame has been reworked to be a series of a team trial, solo trial, and final action that must all be completed in order in a single loop.<br>
            This update marks the end of my planned content. From here out it'll be mostly balancing, bugfixes, and perhaps the occasional addition as whimsy strikes.<br>

                <q>What do stats do?</q>
                <a>Hover over "Stats" for how they work. What stats are important depend on what actions you need that
                    uses them.

                <q>Short runs seem better.</q>
                <a>Short runs are better for the early game, but as your runs get longer and you accrue
                    talent and soulstones, longer runs become more useful.

            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>What should my first goal be?</q>
                <a>Start with wandering until you have ways of getting mana back. Then try to find how to get some
                    warrior lessions to give yourself a permanent boost, and then try fighting monsters!
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>How do skill increases / reductions work?</q>
                <a>Increases multiply a reward by (1 + level / 60) ^ .25, so you'll see diminishing returns at higher levels.
                Reductions multiply a cost by 1 / (1 + level / 100), so you'll never be able to bring a cost completely to zero.
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>When should I use Dark Ritual?</q>
                <a>Many people recommend performing another ritual when the cost is less than 5% of your soulstones.
                Of course, the choice is up to you and there may be cases where it's better to perform it sooner or later.

            <story num="0"> <!--Beginning of Game-->
                You're a simple courier, on a long trip to deliver a high priority package. Just as you entered town,
                you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you.
                Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana became empty, you
                found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves
                filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you,
                until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are
                often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...
            </story>
            <story num="1"> <!--First Soulstone-->
                You reach the end of the dungeon, where a softly glowing orb floats on a pedestal. You've found the
                dungeon core - for the first level of the dungeon, at least. As you grasp it, the essence dives into
                you, infusing your very being with the power it holds. It is a small amount of power, but this is a
                small dungeon. You'll be back to take this power again, knowing with the foreign knowledge implanted
                that it will stay with you no matter when you are.
            </story>
            <story num="2"> <!--No Soulstone-->
                You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been
                thought that dungeon cores build based on the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the
                essence of it's previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to
                put more mana into the world to take the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another
                oddity of the loops.
            </story>
			<story num="3"> <!--Change 3 to Forest-->
				After spending most of a loop preparing, you're finally ready to leave Beginnersville. In a way, you're
				going to miss this town, and the thought of leaving almost brings a tear to your eye - until you realize
				you'll just be back next loop. Grumbling, you set off, hiking into the forest, but by the time you're
				ready to make camp, you're in a good mood again. The forest is beautiful, teeming with life, and looks
				to have boundless places to explore. Best of all, on your way here, you passed several locations that
				are absolutely saturated with mana - you think you'll check those out first.
		    </story>
		    <story num="4"> <!--Merchanton-->
				It's always nice, after doing the same dull tasks as always, when you reach the forest and get to do
				something new. Whether you're exploring, hunting, learning something or just sitting by the waterfall,
				the forest always makes a great backdrop. However, as pleasant as it's been here, it's time to move on,
				at least for now. It would be a long trip, but luckily, after all your exploring, you know some shortcuts,
				and before long, Merchanton emerges out of the trees. There's a lot to do here! Maybe one of the guilds
				can help you with your looping problem! Or maybe there's a book in the library that can lead you to a
				solution! Or maybe... or maybe... that all sounds like a lot of work, and you have been going through a
				lot lately. Maybe before any of that, you should find a bar and get a drink.
			</story>
			<story num="5"> <!--Change 5 to Mt. Olympus-->
				You have explored the guild options in Merchanton and have maybe made a few guild friends along the way, Time to grab
				pickaxe and start the climb! Reaching Mt. Olympus takes alot of climbing but during the climb you discover these mana
				geyser but looks like they can be harvested with a pickaxe. You discover runes scattered around the mountain, maybe
				deciphering them might be useful and about half way up this mountain you discover a massive cavern with room to take a
				break climbing and explore it, You met these Friendly Trolls in these caverns however they don't sell snowcones...
			</story>
			<story num="6"> <!--Good Reputation Story--> <!--Change 6 to Valhalla-->
				You have finally reached the top of Mt. Olympus there is a giant door at the very top, a voice rings out "It is time
				to face JUDGEMENT of the GODS, HAHAHAHA. Hope you are prepared for judgement!" After waiting for what feels like hours
				the voice rings out "You may PASS!". You enter the wonderful place called Valhalla, you	 have a tourist show you around
				and even looks like a charity is happening. After exploring you realize also can join charm school or wizard college,
				become a citizen, and even fight with the Valkyries. Home of the gods couldn't be any better.
			</story>
			<story num="7"> <!--Bad Reputation Story--> <!--Change 7 to Startington-->
				The voice rings "You Shall Not PASS!". You feel like you are being lifted and are chucked off Mt. Olymupus and into the
				shadow realm. The shadow realm opens up and you hit the floor luckily with only a scratch, after a few hours you finally
				can get up and realize that this isn't beginnersville anymore. After closer inspection of the ruins nearby you realize these
				ruins is alot more twisted and strange that you thought they were gonna be. You notice these strange pylons and seak to destroy
				them and a few minutes later you look and finally notice the giant spire in front of you!
			</story>
			<story num="8"> <!--Change 8 to Jungle Path-->
				Before you leave Startington you realize you don't have the supplies you got in Beginnersville, but lucky for you Startington
				sells another supply set but rumor has it that the shopkeeper is kinda deaf so your haggles won't work on them. You get your
				supplies and you set off down the trail, reminds you of the forest. You walk untill you see a jungle up ahead with ruins all

				You have made the Loop Potion after learning alchemistry and grabbing herbs from the forest, you take a bit to brew the
				concoction and after it boils a bit and the herbs soak into a nearby mana geyser then you pour it into a bottle. After
				a glance you have no doubts that it is the think you spilled back in beginnersville, but you have no idea what to do
				with it now.

			<story num="10"> <!--Change 10 to Commerceville-->
				After you explore the ruins you notice the exit out of here is gonna be blocked of soon might have to beat the loop fast enough.
				You just beat the exit just barely and notice that there is another small city, time to pay someone to show you around town! The
				guide shows you the explorers guild and explains that they have many perks for joining, nifty! The guide also takes you down
				a alley way and shows you that you can join the Thieves Guild to make a little bit of cash. After the guide is done showing
				you around town he explains that they are with the tax collectors and you probly should be going now, quickly you make it to
				the Bank and you notice a hooded figure might be worth checking what they do.
			</story>
			<story num="11"> <!--Change 11 to Valley of Olympus-->
				After you take a heafty loan from the bank you can now own Commerceville and leave while you still can, after you walk down the
				road you realize you can move the stones from the Jungle and move them to build a great tower. After you build the great tower
				you realize you can't reach Valhalla unless you can clear trial of the gods to prove worthy of entering again. After finally
				clearing the trial of the gods, the voice speaks "The 7 gods of this land protect this world, if you want to enter Valhalla
				you can defeat us to be worth of the throne." After a long battle the last god goes down and you gain the power of all 7 gods,
				with great power you can end the time loop now and forever!

				<![CDATA[
				   You've done it! You've bested the gods themselves and restored time to its rightful flow. You can stop looping at any moment.
				   But, then again, you could keep going. There's always time later...
				   Thanks for playing my fan mod of Idle Loops!
				   Big shout-out to the wonderful Stop_Sign for creating this amazing game and Omsi for all the Omsi version.
				   You both have inspired me more than you can imagine.
				   Hope everyone had fun! <3 <br>

            <explanation><![CDATA[
          Each stat level reduces the relevant part of an action's mana cost by 1%.<br>
          Talent exp gain is equal to 1% of stat exp gain, and persists through loops.<br>
          Talent multiplies xp gain by (1+(talentLevel)^0.4/3).<br>
          XP gain towards a stat per action is (original mana / actual mana) * (talent bonus) per tick.<br>
          Total Mult is a combination of your talent and soulstone bonuses.<br><br>
          e.g. Meet People costs 800 mana and has a breakdown of <div class="bold">Int</div> 10% <div class="bold">Cha</div> 80% <div class="bold">Soul</div> 10%.<br>
          This effectively means 80 of the mana is controlled by <div class="bold">Int</div>, another 80 by <div class="bold">Soul</div>, and the remaining 640 by <div class="bold">Cha</div>.<br>
          If your <div class="bold">Cha</div> is level 20 when the action is started, the bonus would be x1.2 so it'd be 640 / 1.2 = 533.33<br>
          Adding back the 160 from <div class="bold">Soul</div> and <div class="bold">Int</div>, the total mana the action takes (rounded up) is now 694, so ~87% of the original mana cost.<br>
          The action would give (800/694)*(1+(talent)^0.4/3) level exp per mana for the 694 mana.]]></explanation>

Preparing the altar is surprisingly tame, all said and done. Stone and wood comprise most of the altar and the rest you brought with you when you made this plan. In the end the altar you build is only small, a communion point instead of a summoning. Holding a heart from nearby deer, you pierce it and begin to chant ritualistic words of power. The clearing grows dark and the forest quietens, nary a sound is heard apart from the drip drip drip of the blood from the pierced heart in your hand.

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ Chronomancy is unlike any other magic you've practiced, and unbelievably finnicky.
